This program was made by Agafitei Razvan.
This is a simulator of planetary orbits
The program gathers data provided by the user in Solar UNITS : masses in units of the Sun's mass , distances in units of the Astronomical Unit.
One unit mass equals 10^20 kg, one unit distance equals 1000km, one unit time is approximately one sideral month.
The pozition vector(0,0,0) has no special properties.
The General Theory of Relativity or the Special Theory of Relativity were not implemented as of the date of writing the documentation.
This version uses a O(n^2) algorithm


The algorithm computes for each and every pair of bodies the force between them. It calculates each bodies's acceleration, velocity and position


Areas to look into:
- create unit and zero vector for better readability
- design and implement an algorithm that takes into account energy losses and compensates for them
-improve performance
-introducting equatorial coordinates
-creating a graphic interface
-conversion to real World units



version 1.0 is avaible on github


version 1.1
update to the physics part of the program
about twice as accurate with the same time and memory complexity
